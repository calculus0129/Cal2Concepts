\intro{
The Black-Scholes model is a mathematical model for pricing an options contract. The model was developed by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton in the early 1970s and is a cornerstone of modern financial theory. The Black-Scholes model provides a closed-form solution for the price of European call and put options.
